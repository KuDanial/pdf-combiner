PDF Combiner Package Installation Instructions
===========================================

To use the PDF combiner functionality, you need to install the PyPDF2 package. Here are the installation instructions:

1. Using pip (recommended):
   ```
   pip install PyPDF2==3.0.1
   ```

2. If you're using a requirements.txt file, you can add this line:
   ```
   PyPDF2==3.0.1
   ```
   And then run:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. If you encounter any permission issues, you might need to use:
   ```
   pip install --user PyPDF2==3.0.1
   ```

4. For Windows users, if pip is not recognized, you might need to:
   - Open Command Prompt as Administrator
   - Use the full path to pip:
     ```
     python -m pip install PyPDF2==3.0.1
     ```

Note: Make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system.

Troubleshooting:
- If you get a "pip not found" error, make sure Python is properly installed and added to your system's PATH
- If you get permission errors, try running the command prompt or terminal as administrator
- If you have multiple Python versions installed, make sure you're using the correct pip version for your Python installation
